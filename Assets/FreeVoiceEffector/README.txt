- How To Use

    First, drag and drop the "Assets/MagicVoiceEffecter/Prefabs/MagicVoiceEffectManager.prefab" into the hierarchy window. 
    Then, add the MagicVoiceEffectController script component to the game object that 
    contains the audio source where you want to apply the effect. 
    In this script, change the state and value parameters, and then play to see the effect applied.

- Features and Limitations
    This collection comprises seven types of professionally mixed direct effects, two types of spatial effects, 
    and the creation of two special clips. 
    Even if you are already using Unity's built-in mixers, the audio sources with applied effects from this collection 
    forcibly assign an output bus group to ensure the effects are applied. 
    Consequently, these audio sources will not additionally apply any effects that you have already set on your buses. 
    If you wish to add your pre-set audio effects to these transformed sounds, 
    simply save the transformed sound as a separate audio clip and then reassign the output group bus to use the original bus.
